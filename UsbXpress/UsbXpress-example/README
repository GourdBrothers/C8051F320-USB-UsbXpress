The directory where this workspace is located contains the following interesting 
subdirectories:

  lib      Directory containing the USBX library.
  src      Source/header files for the example.
  proj     Contains the project files for the examples.
  Host     This directory contains the host (PC) applications and usb drivers
           used for testing the examples.

When the application is built, it will generate binary output to the 
subdirectory "Device" in the directory where this workspace is located. The 
project is pre-configured for debugging on the target via the Silabs USB debug
adapter. In order to test the example, connect the board to the PC via the 
on-board USB connector and launch the Host application corresponding to 
the example you are working with.
